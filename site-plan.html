      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Your purpose here]</p>  Yards are one of those things that need to be taken care of, but sadly they are often put on the backburner.
      That is because a lot of homeowners don’t have the time for the up keep that yards require.
      And that is where Hamilton Lawn Care comes in.

      We do it all, and we can and will leave your property ready to host one of the best parties ever!
      So what are you waiting for?? Give us a call!!
      


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[Your audience here]</p>  My audience are those who are too busy to find the time to do their own yardwork. A lot of places try and target the very wealthy however because of my prices, I can target anyone who wants some extra time to go out and play. I’m also looking to target the older generation, businesses, HOAs, and apartment complexes. I’m also looking to target those who are just needing a little bit of help and then they can start to take care of their own! We are here just to help out the people!!
